<p>
After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment 
of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. He started his career by designing a small 
hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. 
Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam 
was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite 
Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started
work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and
expanded the programme to include more engineers.
